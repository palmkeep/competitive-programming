# competitive-programming

Solutions to problems from various competitive programming sites.

Beware of old, questionable-looking, code.

* More general solutions can be found under the directory 'algorithms-and-datastructures'
* Problems found at 'Open Kattis' have been put in directory named after the problem title.
* Problems I could only find through 'Online Judge' (UVa) are prepended with a 'u' and the problem number at UVa.
